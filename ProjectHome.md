# Welcome to Project JavaFXGraph #

JavaFXGraph provides a JavaFX 2.X control for building graph-a-like zoomable user interfaces.

The user interface is build on a graph model, and the model is rendered using JavaFX. You can nagivate inside the model using the mouse, and also zoom in and out to view more detail or to get an overview from an higher perspective.

See the following screenshot for an example application with animated zooming and selection:
